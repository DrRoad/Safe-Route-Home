    "We pulled from the Boston Crime data set located on the boston.gov website. We were fortunate that the dataset was clean so we did not have to format the data further. When the user fills out the location form all the data points are passed through the URL parameters, and the crime database is filtered based on the user's safety requirements indicated by the checkboxes. The database is then iterated through into a python dictionary which is passed to MapQuest as a JSON object of crime points to avoid along with the start and end location. Map Quest then returns to Django another JSON object which contains various navigation information and step by step directions. We then parsed through that data and iterate over it into our HTML template.\n"
